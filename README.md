## ðŸ“‹ Task Model (Back-End)
Each task is represented by the following attributes:
- `id`: Auto-incrementing numerical ID.
- `description`: Text (max 120 characters).
- `completed`: Boolean to reflect task status.
- `createdDate`: Auto-generated date when the task is created.
- `dueDate`: User-inputted due date.
- `completedDate`: Date auto-generated when a task is marked as completed.
- `priority`: Priority level (`Low`, `Medium`, `High`).

## ðŸ”§ Tests

### Front-End Tests

We have implemented unit tests for various components using Jest and React Testing Library. These tests ensure that the components render correctly and handle user interactions as expected.

#### Components Tested:
- `TaskTable`
- `TableErrorMessage`
- `StatsTab`

#### Running Front-End Tests

To run the front-end tests, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the front-end project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ./front-end/to-do-front
  ```

2. Install the dependencies if you haven't already:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

3. Run the tests:
  ```bash
  npm test
   ```

This will launch the test runner in interactive watch mode, allowing you to see the test results and any errors.

### Running Back-End Tests
To run the back-end tests, follow these steps:

#### Running Back-End Tests
To run the back-end tests, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the back-end project directory:
  ```bash
  cd ./back-end/BreakableToy
  ```

2. Run the tests:
  ```bash
  mvn test
  ```

This will execute the unit tests and provide a summary of the test results.
